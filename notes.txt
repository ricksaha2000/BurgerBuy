In folder containers , stateful components.
In folder components , dumb or stateless components.


If in Layout.js we are passing props.children it means that other compinents can be wrapped in the Layout....
if not , then no props.children
Object.keys(props.ingredients)
                .map(igKey=>{

// This takes the Objects and handles the keys , and stores them in an array and the map function iterates over them.
//So igKey is meat,cheese etc.....

const x = [...Array(props.ingredients[igKey])]


Here x creates an Array using the function Array()-->JS function

so it actually takes in as an argument the length of the array , here for each igKey , we access the amt of item reqd , and create an array of that size.
Creates an empy array of that size and then what we do is this -->
eturn [...Array(props.ingredients[igKey])].map((_ , i)=>{

    //    in map we traverse the previous created array and _ mean we are not interested about the value of that position , but the index , i.e. i of the 

                                return <BurgerIngredient key={igKey+i} type={igKey} />
